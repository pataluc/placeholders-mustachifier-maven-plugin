placeholders-mustachifier-maven-plugin
======================================

Transform a text file full of `{{placeholder:value}}` into a file with only `{{placeholders}}` or only `values`.

More information here: http://xebialabs-community.github.io/placeholders-mustachifier-maven-plugin/0.5-SNAPSHOT/

The unit test uses a nice tool called `Restito` https://github.com/mkotsur/restito to mock the REST calls

Docker
------

The docker folder contains two images to build the plugin using java7 or
java8


Install Locally
------

By default jar is signed after packaging and before installation. To skip that (testing):
```
mvn -Dgpg.skip install
```
